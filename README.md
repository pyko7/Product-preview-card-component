## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

I've set myself the challenge to create this card in less than 1 hour. Unfortunately, I missed the challenge by 15 minutes. Next time will be the one !
